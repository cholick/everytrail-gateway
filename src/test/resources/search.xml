                <![CDATA[The Chirico Trail is a lovely spot located just off of I-90 in Issaquah. It is conveniently located and after about 700 feet of elevation the noise from any roads disappears. It is easy to reach and leaves the user in the forest and forgetting how close I-90 and Highway 18 are for most of the trail. The south launch area allows the users to have lovely valley views while looking out over the top of the nudist colony. The north launch area of Poo-Poo Point allows the user to have lovely views of the Lake Sammamish and Issaquah.  ]]></overview>
            <tips>
                <![CDATA[Standard day-hiking gear is utilized and what is required will depend upon the day. In winter, the trail can be wet from rain or slippery with ice, depending on the weather. In summer, the trail is used more frequently and ofter users are found hiking up wearing shorts and t-shirts. Again, watch out of the pilots about to land as one enters the landing zone (LZ) at beginning and conclusion of the trail. ]]></tips>

            <subtitle><![CDATA[Enjoy an easy hike through the Cascade foothills to a beautiful set of waterfalls, only 30 minutes from downtown Seattle ]]></subtitle>
            <overview>
                <![CDATA[This popular trail follows the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River through the rainforests along the western edge of the Cascade Mountains. The trail provides spectacular views of Twin Falls. Most people park at the Twin Falls Trailhead located off of Exit 34 on I-90. A little over a mile from the trailhead, a set of stairs descends to a viewpoint of the Lower Falls as they plunge over a 150 foot cliff. Hike another quarter mile to a bridge that spans the narrow Twin Falls canyon. From the bridge you can see several plunge pools of the Upper Falls upstream and the edge of the Lower Falls downstream. Less than a quarter mile from the bridge is a view of the Upper Falls from above. Most visitors turn around at this point as the trail starts climbing steeply. Those hearty enough to continue will find that, the trail intersects with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail in a little under a mile. The John Wayne Pioneer Trail is a 108 mile long trail that follows the old Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul-Pacific Railroad from Cedar Falls to Vantage. Hike east along the Pioneer Trail for a quarter mile to reach the Olallie State Park Homestead Valley Trailhead (located off I-90 Exit 38). ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[Discover Pass is required.

Dogs on leash.

Avoid the summer crowds by visiting on a weekday.

Parking at the trailhead is limited. ]]></tips>

            <subtitle><![CDATA[Atop Rattlesnake Ridge great views of the surrounding mountains can be seen including Mount Si and Mount Washington. ]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This is a very popular trail in the summer months. It is a short 30 minute drive from downtown Bellevue or under an hour away from Seattle. Not only does this trail provide you with great panoramic views from atop Rattlesnake Ridge but there is also a great park located down below. Many people come to the use the lake in the warmer months. There are no motored boats or fishing allowed on the lake which makes this place ideal for kayakers and swimmers alike.

You can also find several connecting trails within the Rattlesnake Ridge parking area. At the end of the Rattlesnake Ridge trail you can continue on for a full day hike along the Ridge on the East Peak trail or complete the 10 mile trek to Snoqualmie. Additionally you can find the Snoqualmie Valley Trail just as you leave the parking area. This is a great trail if you are looking for a long hike or bike ride. The trail starts south of Rattlesnake Lake and continues up to Duval, over 35 miles of converted railroad to trail. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get there:

Take I-90 east and get off on Exit 32, 436th Avenue SE, just past the exits towards North Bend. Take a right off of the exit, heading south on 436th Ave SE which turns into Cedar Falls Road. Travel about three miles and follow the signs posted for Rattlesnake Lake. You will see several parking areas on both sides of the street. The park is a very popular location in the warmer months due to the lake. You may have to park on the edge of the road if the park is crowded.

Hours:

The park is open year around, dawn to dusk.

Amenities:

-There are restrooms by the lake as you enter the park.
-No camping is available in the park.
-An additional portable restroom is located in front of 
 the trailhead marker.
-No water is available within the park, you should pack 
 your own water.
-On Cedar Falls Rd, the road leading up to the park, there
 is a small shop where you can purchase food and drinks. ]]></tips>

            <title><![CDATA[Lower Coal Creek Trail]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Nature hike with multiple Coal Creek crossings.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This trail is an excellent finish to the four trails of Coal Creek Park. This trail offers the best views of Coal Creek and offers more of a challenge. The hills are not terribly steep but there are many and opportunity to rest is few.

Starting out from the parking lot on SE 60th you will descend into the forest on a set of wooden stairs. The trail will continue downhill for a bit making for an easy trip down to Coal Creek. On your way down you will come across a few switchbacks that will help ease this down hill portion. Shortly, you will come to an opening in the forest, as you pass through you will hear the hum of the power lines above. Moving back into the forest you will be close to reaching Coal Creek. There are a few downed trees on this section of the trail, careful when jumping over as the trail begins to get muddy. You should now begin to hear the sound of Coal Creek. You will catch a quick glimpse of the creek as you come to a fork in the trail. Taking the fork to the right is a large bridge that crosses over the creek.  I think this is one of the best spots to photograph the creek. If you have hiked the other trails in the park you can agree that this is the largest portion of Coal Creek yet. Continue up the trail and it will lead you out onto Coal Creek Parkway. It is a busy road that will lead you to no other trails. I suggest forgoing the rest of the trail and returning to the fork from hence you came. Moving North on the trail you will see a sign explaining that improvements are being made to the trail ahead. The trail will narrow and is less maintained, if it is wet out and you do not have a pair of shoes with good grip, I would suggest turning back now. At first the trail is muddier and along the way you will come across several bridges. Most of the bridges are at some stage of repair or replacement; see my photos to check out the bridge conditions and warnings. One short bridge in particular is about ready to collapse, lucky it is easy to walk around if careful. Nearing the end of the trail you will again reach a few switchbacks, this area is extremely slick. It appears to be compacted clay and even walking very slowly I noticed I was sliding down the hill. If you have made it this far you are almost at the end. Crossing another newly constructed bridge, you will come to another fork in the trail. Follow the signs, just .2 miles to the end where you will be rewarded with a great view of Coal Creek. Here you will see the two sections of the creek join into a small pond that disappears into a concrete storm drain.

This trail is just over 4 miles out and back. I think it provides the best views of Coal Creek and will be the best hike in Coal Creek Park when all improvements have been completed.
 ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

From I-405 take the Coal Creek Parkway Exit, head South for 1.7 miles, turn right onto SE 60th street, you will go up a curvy hill, on your right look for a small gravel parking lot. The parking lot holds 3 cars and is marked with a small sign for the nature area. You should also see a large sign for Newport Hills at the entrance.

Park Hours:

There are no posted hours but would only hike during daylight hours.

Amenities:

-There are no restrooms in the park
-No water fountains, bring your own water or a water purifier if using the creeks water
-I suggest bringing an extra pair of shoes if you complete the entire trail, may be muddy on heavy rain days
-You are very close to a few gas stations and stores if you need any supplies

            <title><![CDATA[Coal Creek Trail]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[A short hike through the woods while exploring the area's coal mining history.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This is an easy hike that will lead you through a historical coal mining region. While the towns are gone you will still be able to view some artifacts from the past. Along the way you will see a coal mine shaft and an information kiosk where you can learn more about its history. There are also a few railroad cart turntables but they are difficult to spot as their concrete foundations are all that is left and the forest has now grown over them. During your hike you will also catch the smell of coal and burnt cinders from time to time.

Most of the trail is packed dirt but there are a few hills that can be slippery especially after it rains.  I would suggest wearing hiking boots or a good pair of trail running shoes. This trail has recently received some attention in the form of new bridges. As of August 2010 the park service has been busy replacing many of the bridges in the park. The new structures are larger and sturdier than the ones being replaced. One bridge in particular was an adventure to cross and may have been a deterrent to some, but now all river and stream crossings are possible.

If you start your journey from the Red Town parking lot, you will quickly come across an old coal mine shaft. It has been sealed but when standing next to it you can still smell the coal from below. Next to the mine is an information kiosk that will provide you with a little history of the area. It is interesting to read about the towns that were here and try to imagine what life would have been like while traversing the trail of today. On the kiosk you will see a few photos of the miners and their mining village. A little further down you will come to the North Fork Falls along with a few benches to sit and enjoy the waterfall. The falls are not large and it is best to visit them after a few days of heavy rain. From here you will walk through the forest and onto a short section of the trail composed of gravel. The trail is mostly a gentle down hill hike where you will make a few stream crossings on the newly renovated bridges. Soon you will find yourself in a clearing with many black berry bushes, watch out for the thorns as the trail is overgrown at times. Once you make your way back into the shaded forest the trail begins its steep decline. At first you will be hiking down a small ridge but it will begin getting steeper and muddier from here.  For this next section you may need to take advantage of the trees and their roots to guide yourself down, especially if the trail is wet. Once at the bottom the trail will level out and you will come to the last two bridges. Once you cross the first bridge you will come to the Forest Drive trailhead. Continue straight to cross another bridge and a short distance later you will see a small retention pond along with the fish ladders at the end of the trail.

At a distance of 2.8 miles, 5.6 miles out and back, this hike will provide you and your family with a great short outing along with some history. However if you are looking for a longer hike there are 2 connecting trails, Primrose Trail (.8 miles) and the Forest Drive Trail (about 4 miles out and back depending on route), which can make this a full day hike. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:
From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. This is also the Cougar Mountain parking area. The Coal Creek trail is just across the street from the parking area. Use caution when crossing the street as there is no cross walks.

From Interstate 405, take the Coal Creek Parkway exit which leads you to the city of Newcastle; turn left on Southeast 72nd Street and then another left onto Newcastle-Coal Creek Road. There will be a small dirt parking area about 1.8 miles from the exit. 

Park Hours: 
The park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk ]]></tips>

            <title><![CDATA[Wallace Falls Hike]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Beautiful, well-groomed trail up to a beutifull series of waterfalls]]></subtitle>
            <overview>
                <![CDATA[Wallace Falls is set of nine different cataracts in all which are well worth the hike up.  The hike is short enough for a day time picnic outing.  But, be prepared to get a little exercise as it is a 1200 foot elevation gain up to the falls.  On the trail, you'll find many examples of Cascade regional flora and fauna as well as some old growth forest.  The trailhead is easy to find with public bathrooms and drinking water available.  The path and well marked with bridges and nicely railed vista platforms to view the falls.  There is also a covered picnic area when you reach the bottom falls.  If it weren't for the elevation gain, I would recommend this hike for all children.  However, I'd only take kids that are over 4 years old or very athletic.  A lot of people stop at the picnic area to turn around and go back.  However, if you hike the next mile, you'll get to see all of the upper falls which are quite beautiful.  The one problem with this trail is that it is very popular and you will encouter others along the way. ]]></overview>
            <tips>
                <![CDATA[You should wear sturdy shoes although sneakers and tennis shoes should work fine.  Bring a water bottle to fill up at the trailhead as there is no drinking water available along the trail.  If you bring your dog, it must be on a leash.  This trail is definitely camera-friendly.  Don't bother with a swimsuit for the creek or falls as this is not encouraged or safe.  It's best to leave for the hike with plenty of time to get back before it is dark. ]]></tips>

            <title><![CDATA[Wildside Trail]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This is one of my favorite trails to run on within the Cougar Mountain Park. It has a lot to offer in the form of scenery, access to other trails, and challenge. This trail can also be difficult to navigate if this is your first time hiking the trail. The first half of the trail seems to end with you having to walk 30 feet in either direction to locate the next trailhead marker. However if you are following the GPS route in this guide you should not have any problems.

Heading out from the parking area you will come to a trailhead marker for Red Town Trail and Wildside Trail. Take the path to the right to begin down the trail. The trail starts off wide and well maintained, however once you arrive at the first bridge the trail can get muddy. Once you cross over the stream you should see a short set of wooden stairs leading up. At the top of the stairs is the junction point for 3 different trails. Head to your left and continue on for 30-40 feet and you should see the trailhead marker to continue on the Wildside Trail. This is where the trail gets muddy; I would suggest having an extra pair of shoes to change into to keep your car clean. Once over the two small bridges you should not have any problems navigating the trail. In about .4 miles you should come to another trailhead marker for Marshall's Hill Trail. Continue straight and the end of the trail will be .3 away from the last junction. This last section can be really muddy; I have had mud come up past my high top boots on a few occasions. When you come to an area with two railroad ties sticking out of the ground you will be near the end of the trail. At the end of the trail you can make a left and take a look at the retention pond, but I would advise against this if you are hiking in the summer time as there will be mosquitoes.

The Wildside Trail offers the quickest routes to the Bagley Seam Trail, Rainbow Town Trail, and Steam Hoist Trail. I would suggest taking this trail if you are trying to see all of the mining exhibits in one day. While it is not a difficult trail it does offer more of a challenge than other hikes on the West side of the mountain. ]]></overview>

            <title><![CDATA[Deception Pass Bridge]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Swirling Fog / Rushing Tides]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[Overview: Looking for a safe harbor? Smooth waters? So was Captain James Vancouver in June of 1798. So he sent Ship&rsquo;s Master Joseph Whidbey with a crew in a small boat around the northeastern tip of what was later named Whidbey Island to search for the inner waterway to Port Gardener. Deceived as to the nature of this passage, he wrote on his chart &ldquo;Deception Pass,&rdquo; and the name stuck.

Today the pass is a beautiful and exotic passage for all manner of water craft as they make their way from the many marinas along the island coast to the larger waters of Puget Sound. Whether its flood tide, ebb tide, or slack tide, you can locate yourself on one of the primary viewing points of the passage and ponder the interaction of the skipper, the ship and the sea.

To reach Deception Pass by land drive west/south on Hwy 20 from I-5, or north from Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island. Coming from the south you&rsquo;ll see a sign for Deception Pass State Park. Turn left into the park and follow the signs to Little North Beach &hellip;. After you&rsquo;ve spent some time on the beach watching the currents and tide, head back out to the main road and continue north. Just across the main bridge, you&rsquo;ll encounter a parking area on the right. This is Canoe Island. From here you can walk across either bridge, or you can explore the island under the main bridge and down into the passage. Further north, on the mainland side of the bridge is another parking area with another fantastic view of the passage. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[1. The currents along the beach in the state park are strong and wild (tides run at speeds up to 7 miles per hour). Be careful.

2. If you&rsquo;re planning to climb around on Canoe Island, wear good shoes. There are many paths that crisscross the island, some rocky and near steep drop offs, some narrow and tangled with tree roots.

            <subtitle><![CDATA[Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[The De Leo Wall Trail can be one of the most scenic trails on the West side of Cougar Mountain. From the scenic overlook you can see the city of Renton to the South and on a clear day Mount Rainier. To get here you can take a few routes, the quickest route is to take Wildside Trail and then take either the De Leo Wall Trail or Marshall's Hill Trail. Both trails will take you to the De Leo viewpoint as the two trails form a loop.

Follow the GPS route closely as there are many unofficial side trails. All of the side trails will lead you out of the Cougar Mountain Park, there will be blue signs indicating that you are leaving the park. The only trail that does not have a trail marker is for the Cross Town Trail, part of the Newcastle city park system, which will have its own wooden trail marker. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. The parking area holds 25-30 cars and has additional parking is to the left of the entrance. 

The quickest way to get to this trailhead is from the Red Town parking area. From the parking area you will see an information kiosk and a dirt path. There are three options at the fork in the trailhead. Follow the trail marker and head down to the Wildside Trail.

Connecting Trails:

-Indian Trail
-Wildside Trail
-Marshall's Hill Trail

Park Hours:

The park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk 

Amenities:

-There is no drinkable water located on the trail. Water 
 should be brought with you.
-There is a water source for horses and pets located on 
 the Red Town Trail, a short distance to the East of this 
 trail.
-The nearest restrooms are located at the Red Town 
 Trailhead just to left of information booth. ]]></tips>

            <title><![CDATA[Bandera Mountain]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[An Alpine Treat Above the Clouds, Great Seattle Hike]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[Late summer days in the Seattle area often begin with a thick layer of gloomy clouds. So you can head east through the I-90 corridor, into the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, to climb above the clouds. Bandera Mountain on the western edge of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area is an excellent place to find the sun and enjoy panoramic views of glacial history written in the rocks of the Cascade Mountains.

The trail up to the summit of Bendera Mountain is 3.3 miles in length (and the same distance back; total 6.6 miles) with an elevation gain of 3048 feet for a final elevation of 5256 feet (according to my GPS). The last 1.5 miles of the trail gain 1800 feet by cutting straight up the mountain on a narrow path (2 feet wide in most places), the last .5 mile gaining 1000 feet. Difficult as this last leg is, the view at the top, and the feeling of accomplishment is not to be denied.
Take Interstate 90 east and get off at Exit 45 (Road No. 9030). At the stop sign, turn left, go under the freeway to Forest Service Road No. 9030. Drive about a half-mile to a road junction and continue straight about three miles on Road No. 9031 to trailhead parking and facilities, elevation about 2,300 feet. Allow about an hour drive time from Seattle. A Northwest Forest Pass is required. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[1. Take plenty of water. After you cross the creek, early in the hike, there are no water sources along the trail to the top.
2. Hiking/trekking poles will give you an advantage, especially as you ascend and descend the half mile to the top and back.
3. Use mosquito repellent! This creature may be the state bird of Alaska and Minnesota, but you&rsquo;ll find it in abundance at the top of the mountain. Since few people actually make the ascent to the top, all of them are voracious. ]]></tips>

            <subtitle><![CDATA[A moderate 6-mile out and back climb of Mount Si in Washington]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[The hike starts at the parking lot and the trail head is clearly marked, in a couple hundred yards you will begin your ascent to the top of Mount Si. The trail is well-maintained and dog-friendly, but be aware that there have been reports of bear spottings on the trail (although not very often).

Most of the hike is under the shade of the trees amove which makes it a good hike even in the heat of summer.

The trail ends on a rocky surface known as the Haystack, which can be very slippery when wet. You'll need some climbing experience if you plan to get to the top of the haystack. ]]></overview>

            <title><![CDATA[Wilderness Cliffs Trail]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Part of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This trail can be accessed from two different routes. The quickest route is to hike up the Squak Mountain Connector Trail from the base of the mountain and continue up onto this trail. This is also the most direct route to reach the peak.

The hike up to the peak on this section of the trail can be difficult when compared to other trails located within the park. To aid in your ascent of Wilderness peak, you will find many switchbacks. Luckily most of the trail is shaded by the thick canopy of trees, making the trail a little cooler. Overall this trail will provide a small you with a small challenge. It is a good warm up hike early in the season before taking on those longer and steeper hikes. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

From I-90, take exit 15 and head south on Highway 900 for 3.3 miles. The trailhead marker will be on your right, see guide photo, there will be an asphalt driveway leading uphill and to the right. The parking area will hold about 15 cars but rarely is full. There is an additional parking area 100 meters east, it is a small dirt pullout that can fit 2-3 cars and gives you direct access to the trail.

Connecting Trails:

Wilderness Peak Trail
Wilderness Creek Trail
Squak Mountain Connector Trail

Park Hours:

8:00AM - Dusk open year around

Amenities:
-a single portable restroom is located at the paved parking area.
-no water sources are available.

            <title><![CDATA[Primrose Trail]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Part of the Coal Creek Park trail system, this trail will take you along a creek with a few small waterfalls. ]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[At only .8 miles the Primrose Trail seems like a quick detour, however, this trail offers some of the best sites to be seen. On this trail you will follow Coal Creek while making a few crossings of the creek via wooden bridges. Along the way you will also pass by Sand Stone Falls, one of Coal Creeks tributaries.

The Primrose Trail is named after a coal seam that was mined in the 1800's. While nature has covered up almost all traces of the mining activities there are a few artifacts that can be spotted along the trail.

I started my hike from the West Primrose trail marker.  The first thing that you will notice is that the trail marker is accompanied by a blue closed sign. I did not take notice of this sign as it was to the far right of the trail entrance. In fact I did not know this trail was even closed until I started making this guide and began to photograph my return trip. After researching the trail further I found out that the Primrose trail has been closed for a few years now due to the trail being washed out. While the trail is a bit rough in places, I found the trail to be easy to navigate. Along the way I found out that I was not alone, several other hikers were on the Primrose Trail with me. At that time I did not think to ask them about the trail closure since I was unaware of the closure.  I believe that many people still use this trail, you can tell by the worn trail and somebody has written &quot;just be careful&quot; on the East trail marker closed sign. With that being said the trail is &quot;closed&quot; but I will describe my hike on the Primrose Trail.

The trail starts out on a slight decline with the trail consisting of hard packed dirt. I came across some blackberry bushes and began to hear the sound of Coal Creek flowing just ahead. When I approached the creek the trail became narrower and I could see a small drop off where part of the trail has eroded away. The trail widens up a bit and again I was walking among ferns and blackberry bushes. For the next few tenths of a mile I followed the creek almost never losing site of it until I came upon Sand Stone Falls. While the falls are not as impressive when compared to the larger Coal Creek Falls, I always enjoy water features on a trail. The falls appear to come from a large black pipe at the top. The water gently trickles down the rocks incline rather than the typical crashing that you would see from other waterfalls. Once past the falls I came across a wooden bridge which crosses over the creek.  The bridge did not look sturdy and a laminated &quot;walk&quot; sign was posted on it. I was to close to the end of the trail to turn back now and decided to press on. Every step that I took on the bridge caused it to shake. I tested each plank before I committed my full weight and continued slowly to the other side. Once on the other side I noticed that many of the screws that were holding the bridge together have now come loose. I&rsquo;m just glad it held together for my crossing. With the bridge behind me the trail began to climb slightly uphill. On one of the first sets of switchbacks I came across another mining artifact, a pair of coal car axles. Past the axles the trail gets muddier and steeper, however this only lasts about .3 miles as I made my way back to the Coal Creek Trail.

This is a great trail with many sites to see while hiking along Coal Creek. I hope that with the current work being done to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail receives some attention and can be reopened soon.

            <subtitle><![CDATA[Follow Field Mouse on a quick educational hike located on Squak Mountain.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[This is a great hike for you to take the kids on. The trail is short and has almost no elevation change to it. It also provides a little education on how the forest and its animals work together to form an ecosystem.

You will follow Field Mouse, who is the lead character, while he takes his first hike into the forest. Along the way he will encounter several of the forest inhabitants who educate him on their jobs in the forest. As you follow along on his journey you will meet a crow, bugs, tree frog, woodpecker, beaver, and a squirrel. Each one of them will explain their role in the forest.

The story of Field Mouse would make a great short story for young kids at home as well. Included in the photos, I copied the information from the stories down. With this guide you will be able to read the story of Field Mouse and his journey any time you wish. ]]></overview>

            <title><![CDATA[Coal Creek Natural Area]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[Look closely to discover pieces from the areas coal mining history along these three trails.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[The Coal Creek Natural Area has three wonderful trails to hike, the Coal Creek, Primrose, and Lower Coal Creek Trail.  All trails will lead you up and down small ravines, through a forest of Douglas Firs, and along the Coal Creek. Along the way you will catch glimpses from the past as there are still many artifacts left over from the areas mining days. In some spots you can still catch the scent of burnt cinders while hiking down the trail.

The Coal Creek Trail is the most frequently hiked trails in the park. Its popularity comes from the variety of attractions all on a relatively short day hike. Nearly all of the best coal mining attractions are found along this trail, from the sealed mineshaft to the concrete foundations of buildings long gone. This trail has recently received many new bridges. That adds to the ease and beauty of the hike.

The Primrose Trail is a short loop off of the Coal Creek Trail. This trail offers a great hike along the creek where you will see a few of the mining artifacts left behind. Unfortunately the trail has been closed due to a portion of the trail being washed out. Hopefully with the renovations to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail will also see some work done on it.

Finally, the Lower Coal Creek Trail is one of my favorite trails in the area. The trail is used infrequently so you will often have this trail to yourself. The lack of hikers is because it is not a well known trail and to the popularity of the nearby Cougar Mountain Trails. However, this is a hidden gem that leads you along portions of Coal Creek. If you have just one hike to pick out of the three trails, I would suggest this one. ]]></overview>
            <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

-For the Coal Creek and Primrose Trails-

From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. This is also the Cougar Mountain parking area. The Coal Creek trail is just across the street from the parking area. Use caution when crossing the street as there is no cross walks.

From Interstate 405, take the Coal Creek Parkway exit which leads you to the city of Newcastle; turn left on Southeast 72nd Street and then another left onto Newcastle-Coal Creek Road. There will be a small dirt parking area about 1.8 miles from the exit. 

-For the Lower Coal Creek Trail-

From I-405 take the Coal Creek Parkway Exit, head South for 1.7 miles, turn right onto SE 60th street, you will go up a curvy hill, on your right look for a small gravel parking lot. The parking lot holds 3 cars and is marked with a small sign for the nature area. You should also see a large sign for Newport Hills at the entrance.

Amenities:

-There are no restrooms in the park
-No water fountains, bring your own water or a water purifier if using the creeks water
-I suggest bringing an extra pair of shoes if you complete the entire trail, may be muddy on heavy rain days
-You are very close to a few gas stations and stores if you need any supplies

Park Hours: 
The park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk ]]></tips>

                    <subtitle><![CDATA[A short hike through the woods while exploring the area's coal mining history.]]></subtitle>
                    <overview><![CDATA[This is an easy hike that will lead you through a historical coal mining region. While the towns are gone you will still be able to view some artifacts from the past. Along the way you will see a coal mine shaft and an information kiosk where you can learn more about its history. There are also a few railroad cart turntables but they are difficult to spot as their concrete foundations are all that is left and the forest has now grown over them. During your hike you will also catch the smell of coal and burnt cinders from time to time.

Most of the trail is packed dirt but there are a few hills that can be slippery especially after it rains.  I would suggest wearing hiking boots or a good pair of trail running shoes. This trail has recently received some attention in the form of new bridges. As of August 2010 the park service has been busy replacing many of the bridges in the park. The new structures are larger and sturdier than the ones being replaced. One bridge in particular was an adventure to cross and may have been a deterrent to some, but now all river and stream crossings are possible.

If you start your journey from the Red Town parking lot, you will quickly come across an old coal mine shaft. It has been sealed but when standing next to it you can still smell the coal from below. Next to the mine is an information kiosk that will provide you with a little history of the area. It is interesting to read about the towns that were here and try to imagine what life would have been like while traversing the trail of today. On the kiosk you will see a few photos of the miners and their mining village. A little further down you will come to the North Fork Falls along with a few benches to sit and enjoy the waterfall. The falls are not large and it is best to visit them after a few days of heavy rain. From here you will walk through the forest and onto a short section of the trail composed of gravel. The trail is mostly a gentle down hill hike where you will make a few stream crossings on the newly renovated bridges. Soon you will find yourself in a clearing with many black berry bushes, watch out for the thorns as the trail is overgrown at times. Once you make your way back into the shaded forest the trail begins its steep decline. At first you will be hiking down a small ridge but it will begin getting steeper and muddier from here.  For this next section you may need to take advantage of the trees and their roots to guide yourself down, especially if the trail is wet. Once at the bottom the trail will level out and you will come to the last two bridges. Once you cross the first bridge you will come to the Forest Drive trailhead. Continue straight to cross another bridge and a short distance later you will see a small retention pond along with the fish ladders at the end of the trail.

At a distance of 2.8 miles, 5.6 miles out and back, this hike will provide you and your family with a great short outing along with some history. However if you are looking for a longer hike there are 2 connecting trails, Primrose Trail (.8 miles) and the Forest Drive Trail (about 4 miles out and back depending on route), which can make this a full day hike. ]]></overview>

                    <subtitle><![CDATA[Part of the Coal Creek Park trail system, this trail will take you along a creek with a few small waterfalls. ]]></subtitle>
                    <overview><![CDATA[At only .8 miles the Primrose Trail seems like a quick detour, however, this trail offers some of the best sites to be seen. On this trail you will follow Coal Creek while making a few crossings of the creek via wooden bridges. Along the way you will also pass by Sand Stone Falls, one of Coal Creeks tributaries.

The Primrose Trail is named after a coal seam that was mined in the 1800's. While nature has covered up almost all traces of the mining activities there are a few artifacts that can be spotted along the trail.

I started my hike from the West Primrose trail marker.  The first thing that you will notice is that the trail marker is accompanied by a blue closed sign. I did not take notice of this sign as it was to the far right of the trail entrance. In fact I did not know this trail was even closed until I started making this guide and began to photograph my return trip. After researching the trail further I found out that the Primrose trail has been closed for a few years now due to the trail being washed out. While the trail is a bit rough in places, I found the trail to be easy to navigate. Along the way I found out that I was not alone, several other hikers were on the Primrose Trail with me. At that time I did not think to ask them about the trail closure since I was unaware of the closure.  I believe that many people still use this trail, you can tell by the worn trail and somebody has written &quot;just be careful&quot; on the East trail marker closed sign. With that being said the trail is &quot;closed&quot; but I will describe my hike on the Primrose Trail.

The trail starts out on a slight decline with the trail consisting of hard packed dirt. I came across some blackberry bushes and began to hear the sound of Coal Creek flowing just ahead. When I approached the creek the trail became narrower and I could see a small drop off where part of the trail has eroded away. The trail widens up a bit and again I was walking among ferns and blackberry bushes. For the next few tenths of a mile I followed the creek almost never losing site of it until I came upon Sand Stone Falls. While the falls are not as impressive when compared to the larger Coal Creek Falls, I always enjoy water features on a trail. The falls appear to come from a large black pipe at the top. The water gently trickles down the rocks incline rather than the typical crashing that you would see from other waterfalls. Once past the falls I came across a wooden bridge which crosses over the creek.  The bridge did not look sturdy and a laminated &quot;walk&quot; sign was posted on it. I was to close to the end of the trail to turn back now and decided to press on. Every step that I took on the bridge caused it to shake. I tested each plank before I committed my full weight and continued slowly to the other side. Once on the other side I noticed that many of the screws that were holding the bridge together have now come loose. I&rsquo;m just glad it held together for my crossing. With the bridge behind me the trail began to climb slightly uphill. On one of the first sets of switchbacks I came across another mining artifact, a pair of coal car axles. Past the axles the trail gets muddier and steeper, however this only lasts about .3 miles as I made my way back to the Coal Creek Trail.

This is a great trail with many sites to see while hiking along Coal Creek. I hope that with the current work being done to the Coal Creek Trail, this trail receives some attention and can be reopened soon.

                    <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

From I-90 East take Exit 13 and make a right at the stop sign. Continue to follow Lakemont Blvd SE and the Red Town Trailhead parking lot will be on the left, about 3 miles away. This is also the Cougar Mountain parking area. The Coal Creek trail is just across the street from the parking area. Use caution when crossing the street as there are no cross walks. Hike in on the Coal Creek trail for 1.2 miles and the Primrose trail begins on your right.

From Interstate 405, take the Coal Creek Parkway exit which leads you to the city of Newcastle; turn left on Southeast 72nd Street and then another left onto Newcastle-Coal Creek Road. There will be a small dirt parking area about 1.8 miles from the exit. Start hiking down Coal Creek Trail; in about .8 miles you will see the trail marker on your left.

Park Hours:

The park is open year around from 8:00AM to Dusk (Primrose Trail currently closed)

Amenities:

-There is no drinkable water located on the trail. Water should be brought with you.
-The nearest restrooms are located at the Red Town Trailhead parking lot.

                    <overview><![CDATA[This trail is an excellent finish to the four trails of Coal Creek Park. This trail offers the best views of Coal Creek and offers more of a challenge. The hills are not terribly steep but there are many and opportunity to rest is few.

Starting out from the parking lot on SE 60th you will descend into the forest on a set of wooden stairs. The trail will continue downhill for a bit making for an easy trip down to Coal Creek. On your way down you will come across a few switchbacks that will help ease this down hill portion. Shortly, you will come to an opening in the forest, as you pass through you will hear the hum of the power lines above. Moving back into the forest you will be close to reaching Coal Creek. There are a few downed trees on this section of the trail, careful when jumping over as the trail begins to get muddy. You should now begin to hear the sound of Coal Creek. You will catch a quick glimpse of the creek as you come to a fork in the trail. Taking the fork to the right is a large bridge that crosses over the creek.  I think this is one of the best spots to photograph the creek. If you have hiked the other trails in the park you can agree that this is the largest portion of Coal Creek yet. Continue up the trail and it will lead you out onto Coal Creek Parkway. It is a busy road that will lead you to no other trails. I suggest forgoing the rest of the trail and returning to the fork from hence you came. Moving North on the trail you will see a sign explaining that improvements are being made to the trail ahead. The trail will narrow and is less maintained, if it is wet out and you do not have a pair of shoes with good grip, I would suggest turning back now. At first the trail is muddier and along the way you will come across several bridges. Most of the bridges are at some stage of repair or replacement; see my photos to check out the bridge conditions and warnings. One short bridge in particular is about ready to collapse, lucky it is easy to walk around if careful. Nearing the end of the trail you will again reach a few switchbacks, this area is extremely slick. It appears to be compacted clay and even walking very slowly I noticed I was sliding down the hill. If you have made it this far you are almost at the end. Crossing another newly constructed bridge, you will come to another fork in the trail. Follow the signs, just .2 miles to the end where you will be rewarded with a great view of Coal Creek. Here you will see the two sections of the creek join into a small pond that disappears into a concrete storm drain.

This trail is just over 4 miles out and back. I think it provides the best views of Coal Creek and will be the best hike in Coal Creek Park when all improvements have been completed.

                    <tips><![CDATA[How to get here:

From I-405 take the Coal Creek Parkway Exit, head South for 1.7 miles, turn right onto SE 60th street, you will go up a curvy hill, on your right look for a small gravel parking lot. The parking lot holds 3 cars and is marked with a small sign for the nature area. You should also see a large sign for Newport Hills at the entrance.

Park Hours:

There are no posted hours but would only hike during daylight hours.

Amenities:

-There are no restrooms in the park
-No water fountains, bring your own water or a water purifier if using the creeks water
-I suggest bringing an extra pair of shoes if you complete the entire trail, may be muddy on heavy rain days
-You are very close to a few gas stations and stores if you need any supplies

            <title><![CDATA[Green Lake Park]]></title>
            <subtitle><![CDATA[One of Seattle&rsquo;s most beloved parks. This hike loops around Green Lake.]]></subtitle>
            <overview><![CDATA[Geologists say the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet, which also formed Puget Sound and other area lakes, formed Green Lake 50,000 years ago. Dredgings of Green Lake have produced volcanic ash from an eruption of Glacier Peak that occurred about 6,700 years ago.

The lake was included in the Olmsted Brothers&rsquo; comprehensive parks plan, and was given to the City by the State of Washington in 1905. Green Lake underwent a series of changes over the next 15 years- it was diked, dredged and filled until it shrunk by nearly 100 acres! The last fill deposited in Green Lake was from the excavation of Aurora Avenue.

In more recent times, Green Lake has suffered from stagnation and pollution problems, as well as algae blooms. Milfoil and swimmers itch (caused by parasites from waterfowl) are still a consideration for those who swim in the lake.
